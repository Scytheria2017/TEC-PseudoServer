Stand-Alone Python/SQLite Implementation of a custom WOW server for solo players. 
The aim is to "wrap" everything into a single launcher which handles connections, databases, packets, etc. and which directly controls the WOW executable. 
Aim is to offer as much flexibility as possible. Target WOW build is Windows 3.3.5a.
